#  IoT_cloud_logging.py
   
#  Example IoT data logging code for the Sense board. 
#  This example is designed to run with Python 3 on a Raspberry Pi.
   
#  Environmental data values are measured and logged to an internet 
#  cloud account every 100 seconds. The example gives the choice of 
#  using either the Tago.io or Thingspeak.com cloud - both of these 
#  offer a free account for low data rates (compatible with this demo).
